      <h1>THIS IS MY FIRST LESSON</h1>
      <p>
        My personal professional development plan is directed towards helping me
        become a better teacher to help students learn and reach their full
        potential. The skills I am working on to be a better teacher include,
        better time management, communication, and having a stronger teacher
        voice. I plan to work on these goals throughout my time at York College
        of Pennsylvania and achieve them by the time I have completed my student
        teaching, which will be in three years. If I feel a goal has been
        achieved before
