            <h1>What does Eid Mubarak mean</h1>
            <p>Eid Mubarak is an Arabic term that directly translates to “blessed holiday” or “blessed feast/festival.”
                Eid is Arabic for “celebration,” “festival,” or “feast” and “Mubarak” translates to “blessed.”
                <br /><br />
                The Eid Mubarak meaning is used as a traditional way to greet someone or offer celebrations in the
                Muslim community during Eid. While it’s been regarded as a religious obligation in the past, the meaning
                of Eid Mubarak is used as more of a cultural tradition in today’s society.

            <h1>Is Eid Mubarak said around the world?</h1>
            <p>While Eid Mubarak is most commonly used by Arab Muslims, it’s becoming more widespread amongst anyone who
                celebrates Eid festivals. <br /><br />
                This includes individuals around the world who participate in Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Eid Mubarak
                wishes are given openly and are a great way to show support of the Muslim culture.

            <h1>What is a Sales Funnel? And how TO Build One in 2022</h1>
            <p>A sales funnel is a marketing concept that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making any
                kind
                of purchase. The model uses a funnel as an analogy because a large number of potential customers may
                begin
                at the top end of the sales process. Still, only a fraction of these people actually end up making a
                purchase. <br /><br />
                There are multiple sales to a sales funnel, usually called as the top, middle, and bottom of the
                funnel, depending on a company’s sales model.One of the biggest mistakes marketers make is that they
                don’t align their content marketing efforts with their sales funnel stages so they can close more deals.
                More often than not, they don’t go deep enough or look into lucrative avenues like repurposing their
                existing content to increase reach. Hence, their prospects don't progress through the funnel. What they
                need is a sales strategy for every stage to engage effectively.

                That’s why I have decided to explain how you can use different content for each stage of your sales
                funnel.

            <h1>How to build a sales funnel for your business</h1>
            <p>Your ad and other content need to take your prospects somewhere. This is where a landing page with a
                cant-miss offer comes in.
                If they click on an ad, sign up for a webinar, or download an ebook, they’ll go to a landing page.
                Your landing page should communicate who you are as a company and your unique benefits. Focus on
                capturing leads instead of pushing sales. This could be the one and only opportunity you have to impress
                your prospects and capture them. <br /><br />
                Make sure the landing page has a form for prospects to enter their information. You want to capture
                their email address so you can continue to communicate with them to steer them towards the next step.
                Your landing page should also have a bold CTA (call to action) that tells them exactly what to do,
                whether it is downloading a free eBook or reading a blog.

        <h1> what is islamic banking ?</h1>
        <p>
            Islamic banking, also referred to as Islamic finance or Shariah-compliant finance, refers to financial
            activities that adhere to Shariah (Islamic law). Two fundamental principles of Islamic banking are the
            sharing of profit and loss and the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and
            investors.These are rare forms of financing, used for certain types of business. These are an exception to
            gharar. The price for the item is prepaid, and the item is delivered at a definite point in the future.
            Because there is a host of conditions to be met to render such contracts valid, the help of an Islamic legal
            advisor is usually required.
